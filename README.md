# Sentiment Analysis with a Google BERT's fine tuning
> 

## Introduction
This project is born for the Laboratory of Data Mining, which is given as an add-on to the Data Mining course in the Master’s Degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Florence.

The aim of this project is to go into detail of Google BERT, which was one of the final leftover topics of the base course, and try an application of it in Sentiment Analysis, with the ultimate goal to fine tune it.


## Technologies and Launch
The code it’s written in Python, and uses Hugging Face transformers libraries for the specific functionalities.

It’s strongly recommended to launch it using a GPU, to keep the execution time reasonable. If you don’t have one, you can use Google Colab.

## Setup and Usage
The file in this repository is in .ipynb format so it is a Jupyter Notebooks, and you can simply open it by importing in Google Colab. 

In the .ipynb file you’ll find a dataset analysis, the BERT model and tokenizer building up, the training and finally the evaluation and the prediction of new examples, with step by step cell of code.  
I’ll add to the repo also the .csv file containing the data used for the train of our Sentiment Analysis model.
